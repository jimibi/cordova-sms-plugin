cordova-sms-plugin
=====================

This Cordova plugin allows you to easily send SMS in android, iOS, and Windows Phone 8. In Android you can use either the native SMS Manager or by invoking the default android SMS app.

This plugin works with PhoneGap 3.x version.

Installation
============

Using the Cordova CLI, run:

    cordova plugin add https://github.com/cordova-sms/cordova-sms-plugin.git

This will place the plugin in your plugins directory and update your android.json file that keeps track of installed plugins.

Then when you run:

    cordova build android


    cordova run android

or

    corcova emulate android

Cordova will put the necessary files into the platforms/android directory. It will update AndroidManifest.xml, res/xml/config.xml, and it will add the src/org/apache/cordova/sms directory.

Example Usage
=============

HTML

    <input name="" id="numberTxt" placeholder="Enter mobile number" value="" type="tel" />
    <textarea name="" id="messageTxt" placeholder="Enter message"></textarea>
    <input type="button" onclick="app.sendSms()" value="Send SMS" />

Javascript

    var app = {
        sendSms: function() {
            alert('click');
            var number = document.getElementById('numberTxt').value;
            var message = document.getElementById('messageTxt').value;
            alert(number);
            alert(message);
            var intent = 'INTENT'; //leave empty for sending sms using default intent
            var success = function () { alert('Message sent successfully'); };
            var error = function (e) { alert('Message Failed:' + e); };
            sms.send(number, message, intent, success, error);
        }
    };

Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

### How can I send an sms in my iOS app without passing control to the native app like it can be done on Android?

This isn't possible on iOS. It requires that you show the user the native sms composer, to be able to send an sms.

Contributing
============

I believe that everything is working, feel free to put in an issue or to fork and make pull requests if you want to add a new feature.

Things you can fix:
* Allow for null number to be passed in
  Right now, it breaks when a null value is passed in for a number, but it works if it's a blank string, and allows the user to pick the number
  It should automatically convert a  null value to an empty string

History

The iOS portion was copied from https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugins by Jesse MacFadyen and then modified slightly to work with this plugin and phonegap 3.x.
